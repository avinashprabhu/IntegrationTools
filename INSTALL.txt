Requirements:

Boost is used for program_options, filesystem, and regex: http://www.boost.org/

The python example script py_test.py uses matplotlib: http://matplotlib.org/


Installing:

You might need to set the following environments variables:

BIN: Where to install 'lw'. If not set, uses /usr/local/bin.
PYINSTALL: Where to install 'pfunction' package.  If not set, uses default distutils location.
BOOST: Where to find boost include files and libraries. Assumes $(BOOST)/include for headers and $(BOOST)/lib for libraries. If not set, uses default compiler search path.

Currently, the PFunction header files are not installed anywhere, just the executables and python package.  But you should probably put them somewhere in your default compiler search path:
- 'cp -r include/IntegrationTools /usr/local/include'

Then cd to the IntegrationTools root directory and make and install with: 'make install'

'make install' will make and install:
- 'lw': The Library Writer
- 'pfunction': Python package (default distutils install location)


Testing:

You can run a test with: 'make test'
